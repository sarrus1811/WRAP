  InstallationNotes: |
    Diaphora is installed as a portable folder containing the plugin files.
    
    To use it, the contents of the extracted folder (diaphora-3.2.1/...) must be manually copied 
    into the 'plugins' directory of your IDA Pro or Ghidra installation. Diaphora also requires a 
    working Python installation and a few Python libraries to be installed.
